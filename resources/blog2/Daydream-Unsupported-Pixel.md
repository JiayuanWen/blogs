Daydream is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Google, where user insert their phone into a headset and use a bluetooth controller to interact with VR contents. 

It was discontinued on October 15, 2019, and support on software level was dropped for any Android phone released after the Google Pixel 4, some older phones have their compatibility removed via Android update.

However, not all hope is lost, as there is a way to get Daydream VR at least partially working without rooting your device, which is what this tutorial aim to do. Do note that it may not work for all device, but the steps only involves installing and uninstalling certain apks, and you are not required to root your device, it's worth a shot.
